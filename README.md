Javascript Array Methods
It talks about Array length which give returns the size of an Array in a function.
The toString method helps to convert an array to a string of array valause using comma separated.
In join method it performs the same function as the Tostring but the join method can specify the separator
The pop() removes the last element in an array while push() adds a new element to an array at the end.
the shift() method removes the first element in an array
the unshift()method adds new element to an array at the beginning
merging also known as concatination adds new array by merging it with the existing ones.
flattening an array is the process of reducing the dimensionality of an array.
With splice() you can add new element to an array, define the position and also state how many element that should be removed.
slice() is used to slice out an element in an array


M MDN WEB DOCS
Mmdn web docs used a general term to define a function as 
A subprogram that can be called. it went further to state that it is 
made up of squence of statements called the function body. it contains a parametre that can be pass to return a value.
In javascript function are regarded as first-class object because they can be pass to other functions and and also return other functions but the only difference is that function can be called but object cannot.
arguments are passed by value but object arguments are passed by sharing, this means that if the object properties are replicated, it will make impact outside the function.
This documentation shows that Javascript has four kinds of function: regular, generator, Async function and Async generator function. for every function, there are three ways to define it: 
1. declaration, 2. Expression 3. constructor

CONTROL FLOW
Control flow help you to take control of how the statement will run in your program, this is based on certain criteria. Javascript has three main control flow: 1 IF/Else statement: this is used to meet up a certain condition {true or false}
, 2. Switch statement:this is used to execute a block of code based on the variables and expression.
 3. Loops.: they are used to execute a block of codes multiple times based on certain condition. Two types of Loops(For and While loop)


EPUB/PDF
it discussed about Functions stating that it allows the code to be called many times without repetition. it also talks about local and global variables.
